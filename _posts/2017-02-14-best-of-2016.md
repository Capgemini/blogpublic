Hello! Are you new here? If so, welcome to the Capgemini Engineering blog. It's written by and for our fellow engineers across the technology industry.

This site has gone from strength to strength since it was created in 2014, and it provides an impressive showcase for the talent, passion and expertise shared among our teams every day. The number of contributors and the range of subjects continues to grow, and this will enhance the value we're giving back to the wider tech community in 2017.

Speaking of "our contributions", let's take a look at our readers' favourite articles of the past year...

## 2016's Most Popular Posts

### [Is REST Best in a Microservices Architecture?](https://capgemini.github.io/architecture/is-rest-best-microservices/)

[Craig Williams](https://capgemini.github.io/authors#author-craig-williams) weighs up the pros and cons of different approaches to using microservices in the implementation of RESTful interfaces. This was by far and away our most popular article of 2016, having been read by 27,217 unique page views (the full hit count was 29,506). Microservices and containers were named as one of Gartner's [top 10 infrastructure-impacting trends of the year](http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-10-technology-trends-impacting-infrastructure-operations/), so it's easy to see why Craig's insightful post drew so much industry attention.

### [Writing Custom Fields in Drupal 8](https://capgemini.github.io/drupal/writing-custom-fields-in-drupal-8/)

Deji Akali shares the fantastic [DrupalCamp](http://drupalcamp.london) slides he presented across the United Kingdom in 2015. This great post can teach you how to take your own Drupal projects to the next level with custom fields in just 13 minutes! Deji starts from the bare basics and uses examples to help you put your new-found knowledge into practice.

### [Creating a CXF REST Service with Camel Blueprint](https://capgemini.github.io/development/creating-a-cxf-restful-service-in-camel-blueprint/)

[Phil Hardwick](https://capgemini.github.io/authors#author-phil-hardwick) explains how Apache's [CXF](https://cxf.apache.org/) and [Camel](http://camel.apache.org/) frameworks are a match made in heaven when it comes to creating scalable and testable Java web services. In little under five minutes you can master the basics, and if Phil's post has whetted your appetite you can take the next step with [this reference example](https://github.com/PhilHardwick/cxf-blueprint-camel-example) and the helpful resources he's linked to.

### [Microservices - A Reality Check(point)](https://capgemini.github.io/architecture/microservices-reality-check/)

[Andrew Harmel-Law](https://capgemini.github.io/authors#author-andrew-harmel-law) shares his thoughts on the new-fangled (as of 2014) microservices trend emerging from in-vogue companies [like Netflix](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/02/a-microscope-on-microservices.html) and the wider Java community. As the ideology and technology behind it matures and is increasingly adopted across the industry, Andrew's post continues to offer an honest and thought-provoking insight into what we gain and lose when we "containerise" new applications and web services.

### [Docker Continuous Delivery Workflows](https://capgemini.github.io/devops/docker-ci-workflows/)

Cam Parry describes his perfect development workflow for creating, testing and securing applications developed and deployed in [Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers. In this well-researched piece Cam provides a [reference example](https://github.com/Capgemini/angular-cart-demo) and also reviews a wide array of useful testing and scanning tools such as [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta), [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/), [Clair](https://github.com/coreos/clair) & [Lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis/).

### [Building Private Ethereum Networks with Docker Compose](https://capgemini.github.io/blockchain/ethereum-docker-compose/)

[Graham Taylor](https://capgemini.github.io/authors#author-graham-taylor) guides you through how to create a private blockchain on your own desktop for testing purposes. While [testrpc](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc) might be your initial "go-to" solution, he explains how to leverage [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to craft a working setup that's much closer to what you'd expect to deal with in production environments. 

If you like this article you should also take a look at [Kubeform: Kubernetes Clusters in any Cloud](https://capgemini.github.io/blockchain/ethereum-docker-compose/), where Graham explains how to use a straightforward visual interface to create a cluster of app containers on almost any virtualization platform.

### [How to do NFR Testing (Non-Functional Testing)](https://capgemini.github.io/testing/how-to-do-nft/)

[Sanjay Kumar](https://capgemini.github.io/authors#author-sanjay-kumar) takes you on a deep dive into the weird and wonderful world of integration testing with [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/), [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/). He starts by explaining how this differs from testing you might already be familiar with and walks you through how to put this knowledge into practice in your real world development setups. Whether you're a rookie developer or a seasoned professional, you're guaranteed to benefit from Sanjay's expertise.

### [What to Look For in a Code Review](https://capgemini.github.io/drupal/what-to-look-for-in-code-review/)

[Malcolm Young](https://capgemini.github.io/authors#author-malcolm-young) describes the anatomy of a good code review and the practicalities around implementing current industry best practice. In particular he details the key things to look out for to ensure your code is secure, scalable, accessible and maintainable over the long term.

### [Little's Law and Kanban](https://capgemini.github.io/agile/Littles-Law-and-KanBan/)

John Shaw explains how Little's Law can be applied to software projects that use Kanban boards to better organise customer demand and workloads. In less than 10 minutes you can discover how to reduce queue times, resolve bottlenecks and boost throughput from your agile development sprints. 

### [Microservices Gotchas](https://capgemini.github.io/architecture/microservices-gotchas/)

[Nick Walter](https://capgemini.github.io/authors#author-nick-walter) lends you his experience about some of the difficulties he and the teams he's worked with have encountered while implementing microservice-driven applications in production environments. This post will help you get a handle on the most common pitfalls so you can mitigate them in your own projects.
