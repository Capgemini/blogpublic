Customers, whether consumer, business, employee, partner, citizen or stakeholder, are demanding the same high grade user experience they experience from the likes of Facebook, Google and Netflix, in the applications and interactions they have with organisations every day.

In the last few years we have seen an explosion in the demand for bespoke-built, high-quality, interactive user interfaces. At Capgemini, we see this manifested as increased demand for frontend development skills,  specifically modern JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue or Ember. Alongside this, the predilection for "JavaScript Everywhere" has resulted in us developing with [React Native for cross-platform mobile apps](https://capgemini.github.io/presentations/fullstack-2017-using-react-native-to-create-a-reusable-mobile-app-architecture/), Node.js for server-side and lightweight APIs, and the [Serverless framework](https://serverless.com/) for deploying Functions-as-a-Service among numerous others I won't list here.

Additionally, we're continually looking at ways to improve the quality, efficiency and reliability of our applications, through applying good development practices like Test Driven Development (TDD) or Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), build automation  tools like Webpack and Gulp, as well as embracing best practices in accessibility and usability.

## We're hiring!

As a result of all this, our Frontend team in the UK is growing, and we need experienced Senior Frontend Developers to lead our development teams across a variety of clients and projects.

We're actively hiring for this role, which you can read more about on our recruitment page for [Senior Frontend Developers](https://www.capgemini.com/gb-en/careers/jobs/senior-front-end-developer/).
