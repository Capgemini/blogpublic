At Capgemini, we're passionate about Engineering and the many facets that make up
successful engineering teams.

We like to experiment with new technologies, establishing
patterns that make our lives easier and more efficient.

We are active in the
various open source communities that our technology choices expose us to.

Above all, we are driven to provide innovative and leading edge solutions for our clients,
who often surprise us with new and interesting technical challenges and business issues.

This blog aims to capture all of this thinking, and share it with the wider
software engineering community. We'll intentionally be talking across different
technologies, reflecting the diverse range of approaches taken with Capgemini.

We will strive for this to be a useful blog, and hope people will learn some things 
from what we share; we know we'll learn from the discussions that we hope
these posts will trigger, so do please join in the conversation.
