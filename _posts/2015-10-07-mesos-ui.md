Today we are open-sourcing [mesos-ui](https://github.com/Capgemini/mesos-ui) - A
realtime, responsive dashboard for Apache Mesos, built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [D3](http://d3js.org), [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org), [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) and [Google Material UI for React](http://material-ui.com).

As part of our work on [Apollo](https://github.com/Capgemini/Apollo) we got thinking that we could potentially improve on the UI offered by Mesos out of the box and started putting a few ideas together as a proof of concept.

We are releasing that proof of concept today in the hope that others in the community might either find it useful, help us test it and report bugs or potentially get involved in taking the development of it forward.

##Â Taking it for a tour

The easiest way to run the UI is to run it as a Docker container. You can do this (in development mode) by executing the following -

```
docker run -p 5000:5000 -p 8000:8000 capgemini/mesos-ui
```

This should start up the UI on port 5000 as well as a backend stub (JSON) server on port 8000. The stub json-server is used so you do not have to have a running Mesos cluster up and running to experiment with the UI. Of course you won't be able to experience any of the realtime updates, because the stub server is essentially static.

### Running the UI in against a real Mesos cluster

If you are already running Mesos and Marathon, the easiest way to deploy the UI is through Marathon itself. We've included a [marathon.json file](https://github.com/Capgemini/mesos-ui/blob/master/marathon.json) in the repository to make this a bit easier for you.

To run the UI in marathon simply edit ```marathon.json``` and replace ```MESOS_ENDPOINT``` with the URL of your Mesos master leader node and then execute -

```
curl -X POST -HContent-Type:application/json -d @marathon.json http://MARATHON_ENDPOINT:8080/v2/apps
```

replacing ```MARATHON_ENDPOINT``` with your live Marathon endpoint URL.

For more instructions about getting up and running see [our readme](https://github.com/Capgemini/mesos-ui/blob/master/README.md).

If you notice any problems with our instructions please [report an issue over on Github](https://github.com/Capgemini/mesos-ui/issues)

Here's a short video of the UI in action which shows the realtime updates occurring as tasks and applications are deployed and scaled in the cluster.
