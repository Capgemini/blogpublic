## We’re Sponsoring ContainerSched! (London 8-9 June)

Coinciding with our [our sponsorship of Devoxx UK](https://capgemini.github.io/agile/were-heading-to-devoxx/) we're also sponsoring, talking at and attending [ContainerSched 2016](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7429-containersched-2016-the-container-and-scheduler-conference) at the same time!

ContainerSched UK has two days packed full of platform and container goodies, with everything from Mesos to Kubernetes, Calico to Weave and Docker to Rkt. We're looking forward to meeting, learning and talking all things DevOps, containers and schedulers!

The Capgemini UK Platform Engineering team will be running a trade stand, manned with some of our cheeriest platform engineers. We'll be showing off some of our latest work (we're always keen to share what we've been up to), answering questions such as “what's it like to work for the largest SI no-one has ever heard of?” but also listening to you and what you have to share with us.

In addition to the stand, our very own [Cam Parry](https://capgemini.github.io/authors/#author-cam-parry) will be talking about "What is enough security in kubernetes and mesos", so come and listen to what he has to say about security, authentication and authorisation in your favourite schedulers.

As a quick plug we're also hiring. Here are just a few of the perks:

 * Surrounded by a growing set of talented and inspiring individuals.
 * The chance to work with some of the largest organisations in the world, delivering complex platforms using container based technologies.
 * Two weeks of training and conference attendance a year. We love sending people to SkillsMatter’s CodeNode in London.
 * Encouragement and support to get involved in and contribute to open-source communities and meetups in any way you can!

 If you want to find out what it's like to be an engineer @ Capgemini drop on by our booth to have a chat.
