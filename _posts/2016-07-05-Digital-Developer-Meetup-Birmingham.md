After the success of our first digital developers meetup last month, we are holding another one at the [Birmingham Custard Factory on the 14th July](https://digitalmeetupinbirmingham.eventbrite.co.uk).  

This event will give you the opportunity to find out about the innovative projects we are working on and how we are using the latest technologies to deliver them. Some of our leading developers will give a series of informal presentations covering our use of Java/JVM, Open Source, DevOps and integration technologies during the evening and there will also be the opportunity to network with them and other representatives from our team. Our recruitment team will also be on hand should you wish to find out more about the interesting technical career opportunities within Capgemini. 

Beer and pizza will be provided to fuel the conversation!
