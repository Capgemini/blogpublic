It's the [2014 Spring eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1941-spring-exchange-2014 "2014 Spring eXchange") at [skillsmatter](https://skillsmatter.com/ "skillsmatter") Thursday, 6th - Friday, 7th November, and Capgemini are incredibly excited to be sponsoring the event!

## Need Some Great Reasons to go to the Spring eXchange 2014?

The Spring eXchange is the best place to learn about the latest developments in the Spring ecosystem, meet real practitioners in a really interactive setting, and hear from some great speakers.

There are three tracks running over the two days; covering Enterprise Java technologies, Big Data and Spring XD, Spring in Production, Spring IO, Spring Data, REST and Microservices - a whole range of Enterprise Java topics. There is a beginners track as well, for those just getting started. 

Whether it’s: 

* Building "Bootiful" Applications with Spring Boot with [Josh Long](https://twitter.com/starbuxman)
* Looking at AngularJS and Spring with [Thorsten Späth](https://twitter.com/thspaeth)
* Designing Spring Boot based REST-ful Micro-services with [Ben Hale](https://twitter.com/nebhale)
* Investigating Microservices with [Russ Miles](https://twitter.com/russmiles) 
* Spring Data REST with [Oliver Gierke](https://twitter.com/olivergierke)
* and many, many more…

There's something for everyone. It's going to be a great couple of days. Come and meet us there!
