Welcome to the Capgemini Engineering Blog. At Capgemini we’re passionate about
software engineering and have got plenty to say on the subject! This is our
blog, written by engineers, for engineers.

Here you will be able to find some of our perspectives, opinions, questions and
solutions which have arisen while creating solutions for both ourselves and our
customers.

We are [a fairly diverse group][authors], and we're proud of [our team culture and ethos][how we work]. 

We're interested in your views too, so please join in the discussion in the comments
areas, or contact our authors on social media.

_Opinions expressed on this blog reflect the writer’s views and not the position of the Capgemini Group._
