# Contributing to the Capgemini Engineering Blog

We welcome posts from all members of the team. If you have an idea for a post, you don't need permission - just follow the process and create a pull request in this repo.

If you arenâ€™t ready to write your post yet, [create an issue](https://github.com/Capgemini/capgemini.github.io/issues/new) -
here are [some current post ideas](https://github.com/Capgemini/capgemini.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"post+idea")

To make sure we're not posting anything which reveals confidential or client specific information, we have a light-touch review process before publishing new posts to the Capgemini Engineering blog. We use the Github pull-request workflow to achieve this.

## Getting Involved
We're always on the lookout for more folks to help out - as well as writing your own posts, please feel free to add your comments to any [open pull requests](https://github.com/Capgemini/capgemini.github.io/pulls). There is also a plan afoot to put in place a "shepherding" plan to help those new to the blogging game.  

If you want to know more, please drop any of the blog maintainers an email and they'll get you added and point you in the right direction. Also, join the [#engineering-blog channel on Slack](https://capgeminiengineering.slack.com/archives/engineering-blog) to join the wider team in discussing the blog, ideas for posts, help writing posts and going through the review process.
